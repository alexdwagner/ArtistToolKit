#Why do I need to apply for Artist residency? 
- Time and space. Usually free space + some programs (professional development) 
- Network and exposure (even if you don’t get it) 
- Continue relation with a city and community  
- Chance to intervene in the MFA and the contemporary fine arts network, curator, writer, gallerist, etc  
- Opportunity for new ideas, inspiration, collaboration
- Support structure for your practice.  
- When you have money, you don't have time. When you have time, you don't have money. Sometimes you don't have money or time.

#Making a living / Making good work
- Survival tactic: Diversify your source of income 
- Working for other artists? Access to connections? 
- Do not over commit or over produce (doing mulitple residencies at the same time is a bad idea) 
- We will never have enough time or resources. Deal with it. (Think of your reality as a creative constraint, not a restriction) 

#Promise me this 

- Create your own residency, $5000 grant for yourself. 17 months plan - save $300 every months from this month. By September 1, 2017. You will have 5000 for your creative work. Invest in your own practice and your team. 

#Residency/ Fellowship/ Commission 
- Expectations and experiences are different. Fellowship often focus on programs and professional developments, Commission focus on making one big project, often with financial support. Residency focus on supporting your practice, for you to make art. Residencies often have no or very little expectation from you, other than using their space and exhibiting work in progress during the open studios. 
- Institutional / Artists-run Spaces
- Residencies that pay you 
- Residencies that are free
- Residencies that you pay 
- This all depends on how the residencies are funded and structured.
