#Why do I need to apply for Artist residency? 
- Time and space. Usually free space + some programs (professional development) 
- Network and exposure (even if you don’t get it) - Continued relation with a city and community (For me, Korea & LA, for my friend, Australia, for you?) 
- MFA and the fine arts network, curator, writer, gallerist, etc  
- Opportunity for new ideas, inspiration, collaboration
- Support structure for your practice.  
- When you have money, you don't have time. When you have time, you don't have money. Sometimes you don't have money or time.

#Making a living / Making good work
- Survival tactic: Diversify your source of income 
- Working for other artists? Access to connections? 
- Do not over commit or over produce (residencies at the same time?) 
- We will never have enough time or resources. Deal with it. (Think of your reality as a creative constraint, not a restriction) 

#Promise me this 

- Create your own residency, $5000 grant for yourself. 17 months plan - save $300 every months from this month. By September 1, 2017. You will have 5000 for your creative work. Invest in your own practice and your team. 

#Residency/ Fellowship/ Commission 
- Expectations and services are different
- Institutional / Artists-run Spaces
- Residencies that pay you 
- Residencies that are free
- Residencies that you pay 
- This all depends on how the residencies are funded and structured.
