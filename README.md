###Reference for Part 1 Writing 
 

Art writings may serve different purposes. In all cases, writing has become an integral part of art practice especially since Conceptual Art. Writing helps bridge the gap between 

**Making** (private practice) - **Experience** (limited engagement) - **Documentation** (post production, archive). 

Art writng can be the vehicle that connect the concept and artist's intention with the practice and actual implementation. Art writing is a valuable resource for artists, their audience and historians as well as the collectors and community who appreciate their work. 
 
####Exercise:

1. Write about one of your project. 200 words. 
2. What do you see, read, hear from your piece? Describe the **experience** of the work.
3. How is it made? Describe the **production**. What is the material, tool and the process? Is it relevant and important for the piece?
4.  What did you try to achieve with it? What is the **message or question**, if any. If there's no message, what was the impulse that drive you to make this?
5.    Read your neighbor's writing, see, read, or experience the work and write about their work in 200 words or less. 

It is very helpful to read writings by other artists you admire. Study their language, description, interviews and reviews. There maybe words and phrases which resonate with you. Appropriate it and make it your own.
