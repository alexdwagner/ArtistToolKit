###Reference for Part 1  
 

Art writings may serve different purposes. In all cases, writing has become an integral part of art practice especially since Conceptual Art. Writing helps bridge the gap between 

**Making** (private practice) - **Experience** (limited engagement) - **Documentation** (post production, archive). 

Art writng can be the vehicle that connect the concept and artist's intention with the practice and actual implementation. Art writing is a valuable resource for artists, their audience and historians as well as the collectors and community who appreciate their work. 
 
Exercise:

1. Write about one of your project. 200 words or less. 
2. What do you see, read, hear? Describe the experience of the work.
3. How is it made? What is the material, tool and the process, if it's relevant and important.
4.  What did you try to achieve with it? What is the single message, if any. If there's no message, what was the drive that made your make this?
5.  When you are finished with the first draft. Write it again using completely different vocabulary.
